        <h2>Joy In The World </h2>
        <p>In today’s tech-obsessed world, social media may well be the perfect platform to showcase the world’s beauty
            to armchair
            travellers across the globe, but travel is so much more than just getting that perfect Instagram shot.
            Travel should be
            meaningful. It should excite and inspire you, rejuvenate and ground you, educate and challenge you, and most
            of all, it
            should humble you.Travel gives us our greatest stories, our most cherished memories and countless
            irreplaceable learnings that we can
            choose to pay forward to others. It teaches us about ourselves and each other, it broadens our horizons and,
            just like a
            reset button, it forces us to refocus on what really matters.

        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>An unmissable destination for travellers, London is a melting pot of history, culture, green spaces and an
            international
            crowd that spills into every delicious corner of its cuisine.My ten things to do in Highbury, Islington,
            London N5 list offers an overview of this leafy North London area. Whether
            you want to relax at Highbury Fields, watch an Arsenal match at Emirates Stadium, dine at a top-notch
            restaurant or
            savour a laid-back brunch, it’s all up for grabs. Other places to check out are St Paul’s Road for
            delightful dining
            spots, while Highbury Park hosts an array of exquisite speciality food stores and some of my all-time
            favourite
            restaurants. While Highbury might often be associated with the Arsenal Football Club, there’s an abundance
            of hidden
            gems just waiting to be discovered, making it an ideal destination for exploration, shopping, and dining.

        <h2>PARIS</h2>
        <p>Paris is the most romantic place in the world. When I woke up in the Latin Quarter where I stayed on my trip,
            I was
            overwhelmed with the bluest sky in the world and the heavenly smell of fresh croissants and chocolate
            crepes. The Latin
            Quarter is significant in the history of France as the sight for several student-led revolutions. Latin was
            the language
            back in the Middle Ages as well.Paris is home to some of the most famous clothing designers in the world
            such as Hermes. I think Paris is the best and
            the worst place to shop. It has great clothing shops but because they are so popular you often feel like you
            are stacked
            in a sardine can.</p>

        <h2>Budapest</h2>
        <p>Budapest is the capital of Hungary, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe with an amazing range of
            incredible
            things to see and do. From the historical and gorgeous building, and delicious street food to Michelin star
            restaurants,
            steam baths, and buzzing ruin bar. I guarantee you’ll fall in love with the place, boasting of its amazing
            attractions.If you only have three days to spend in Budapest, the itinerary can be broken down by these two
            areas. The first day
            will be spending time discovering the Buda side while the next day will be exploring the different
            neighborhoods on the
            Pest side of the Danube River, including relaxing at a thermal bath. Lastly, you can freely enjoy your time
            on food and
            continue to explore what you have missed during the first two days.
